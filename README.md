# NNs-Stock-Pricing-Model

This project is intended to be an introduction into using Neural Networks to predict stock prices. This pricing model uses a neural network comprised of hidden LSTM (long short-term memory) layers in order to accurately predict the stock prices of any underlying stock based on the price of the stock over the last 50 days. It utilises the Yahoo Finance API to download historical stock data alongside a deep learning model, built using TensorFlow.
